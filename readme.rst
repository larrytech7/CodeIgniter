###################
CodeIgniter Plus AdminLTE
###################

CodeIgniter is the popular Application Development Framework we all love. This fork of the project
seeks to integrate the popular UI theme, `AdminLTE <https://adminlte.io/>`_ . AdminLTE is a bootstrap
theme that is growing among developers who seek a quick UI to build an admin interface for their projects.
It brings a whole lot of cool features you can use to build a admin page or user page for your CodeIgniter
apps. This project therefore integrate this theme making it easy for CodeIgniter developers to quickly
leverage the functionalities of the theme in their projects. This project also adds more functionality
to the theme, making it easy for developers to quickly build a full experience of an admin panel.

If you have an extra UI theme, you need me to directly integrate in your CodeIgniter app, shoot me an email
at `Larry Akah <larryakah@gmail.com>`_

It should work on 5.4.8 as well, but we strongly advise you NOT to run
such old versions of PHP, because of potential security and performance
issues, as well as missing features.
